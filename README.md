# Welcome to the Simple Todo List in Angular 2

## What is this?

This site is an example of how to create a simple todo list using [Angular 2](http://www.angular.io) and [ASP.NET Core](http://dotnet.github.io)
I wanted to show basic CRUD functionality as well a simple routing and then compare and contrast this implementation to an [Angular1](http://www.angularjs.org) solution.
 
I used Sqlite for the DB and Entity Framework for DB Connectivity.
I also employed the repository pattern for the DB connection code and registered the Interface for the repository in Startup.cs.

Please note that this is just a simple implementation and there are many ways to do this (as is the case with all software).
This is not meant to be a reference implementation. U assume all risk..;)

##why was it created?

This simple project was created in order to show the differences between building a simple todo list using Angular 2 and Angular 1.
[You can see the Angular 1 version of the site here](http://github.com/aritzcovan/SimpleTodoAngular1) and [get the code for both sites on Github.com](http://github.com/aritzcovan)
